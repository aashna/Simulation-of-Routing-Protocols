Simulation-of-Routing-Protocols
===============================
In this project, we analyze and compare the convergence times of some routing protocols. We consider network of different sizes, each of which were simulated on C++ and Matlab. By examining the results, we identify the routing protocol with the best performance for a large, realistic network. This guided independent work has given me a good understanding of Computer Networks and Computer Graphics.
